### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JS

### What I learned

I Learned a couple of things about CSS

1. Be careful with giving z-index to elements as it caused troubles on selecting the child elements
2. How to utilise json file in plain JS.

### Continued development

MY JS code i feel definitely needs some improvement, i will think of ways to utilise event propagation to make my code follow DRY Principle.For now it works but i'll definitely try to refactor the JS Code to make it more efficient and scalable
